This function prompts the user to input an Instagram username. It then calls the get_user_info function with this username to get the user's details. If there is any error (like the user doesn't exist or the profile is private), it catches the exception and prints an error message.

If there are no errors, it prints the user's name, follower count, following count, and post count in a nicely formatted way.
